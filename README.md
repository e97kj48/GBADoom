## GBADoom

A port of prBoom to the GBA.

**What's hot?**

- Renderer is largely intact. Z-Depth lighting is gone and there is mip-mapping but it's otherwise complete.

- Monster behaviour is all intact. (I.e sound propagation etc.)

- Framerate is pretty variable. Simple areas run at ~35fps. Complex areas (Eg: E4M2) chug along at about 10 FPS. It's running around the same as the original GBA Doom1 and Doom2 ports. Doom1 Episodes 1-3 are all completely playable. Episode 4 chugs.

- Sound and music support. Big thanks to BloodShedder for his Chiptune Doom MOD files.

**What's not?**

- My Markdown skills.

- Demo compatibility is broken.

- General optimisation. We're never going to get a perfect 35FPS but I think there is still another 25% left without changing the visual quality/correctness/game behaviour. For reference, the first time I ran a build under the emulator it ran at about 3FPS.

- Although it is based on prBoom, most of the engine enhancements (dehacked, limit removing etc) have been reverted back to Vanilla. This is either for memory or performance reasons. Sadly, NUTS.wad and Okuplok are right out!

- No multiplayer.

## Building:

To build the GBA version, you will need DevKitArm. The easiest way to get up and running for Windows users is download the installer from here (https://github.com/devkitPro/installer/releases) and install the GBA dev components.

You will also need to use GBAWadUtil, included in the "GBAWadUtil\" directory.

1) Download or Clone GBADoom source code.
Extract the contents to a folder: (Eg: C:\DevKitPro\Projects\GBADoom)

2) Use GBAWadUtil to create a header file with the WAD data. Retail, Ultimate and Doom2 wads have been tested. Plutonia and TNT should mostly work. 
Open a command prompt.
Type the following:
**GbaWadUtil.exe -in doom.wad -cfile doom.wad.c**
And copy the resulting .c file to the **source\\iwad\\** directory.
Alternatively just run the **build_XXXX.bat** files and it'll create it in the source\iwad\ path.

3) Open C:\DevKitPro\Projects\GBADoom\source\doom_iwad.h in text editor or code editor of your choice.
4) Change the first line to #include "iwad/**yourfile**.c" e.g.
#include "iwad/miniwad.c"
#include "iwad/doom.c"
#include "iwad/doom2.c"

5) Run msys2.bat
You may need to edit the msys2.bat with notepad and change the path to go to your real "**msys2\msys2_shell.bat**" file within it if it doesn't work.

6) The project should build GBADoom.gba and GBADoom.elf. It will take about 5 minutes or so. You may see a lot of warning messages on the screen. These are normal.

7) Copy GBADoom.gba (this is the rom file) to your flash cart or run in a emulator.


## Developers:

For development, this project also builds for Windows with Qt. Use the MingW 32bit version or MSVC 32bit. The .pro file at the root of the source tree can be opened in Qt Creator.
